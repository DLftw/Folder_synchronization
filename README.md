# Folder_synchronization
A simple script to backup/synchronize a folder to new folder. The script asks the user via terminal input to specify paths for the locations of the source folder, the replica folder and the log file as well as for a synchronization interval. The contents of the replica folder will then each synchronization interval be synchronized to the contents of the source folder. A statement of the resulting actions will both be printed and added to the log file.
